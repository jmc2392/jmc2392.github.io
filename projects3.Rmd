##Analyzing Likert Scale of Depressive Symptoms

<br>

###Skills
* Data Analysis
* Logistic Regression
* R
* SAS

<br> 

###Background

At the beginning of the Work-Focused Intervention for Depression (WFID) trial, a baseline survey containing questions about respondents' level and frequency of various moods was administered. Researchers gathered responses from 90 individuals in the experimental group and now want to determine the ranking of their responses for one survey question that used a Likert scale - specifically, they want to know whether respondents experienced certain depressive symptoms more often than others. Figure 1 displays the survey question being analyzed and Figure 2 displays a sample respondent answer.

<br>

###Methods
I input the respondent answers into a table (group-level format).

In the table shown below:

* `Obs` is an ID for each row
* `Rating` contains the response rating given by each respondent, from 1 to 5
* `Item` lists the type of mood being considered
* `Count` gives the frequency that each item received for each rating

```{r mood_table, echo = FALSE}
mood <- tibble::tribble(
  ~obs,  ~item,       ~rating, ~count,
     1,  "Depressed",       1,     22,
     2,  "Depressed",       2,     20,

```{r mood_table3, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

I ran an ordinal logistic regression model (proportional odds model) on the data to determine the ranking of each item, modeling the independent variable, item, against the response variable, rating. For the reference mood item, I used "Happy." I assumed that the scale from one response option to another (i.e., Never to Rarely, Rarely to Some of the time, etc.) is the same for all response options; the proportional odds assumption held (p > 0.05) for this model, supporting this. I modeled my parameters over lower-ordered values of the ratings - that is, a larger positive parameter/coefficient indicates respondentsâ€™ preference or tendency toward the lower-numbered ratings for that mood item compared to the reference mood item.

###Results - SAS
The SAS code and output for the model is provided below.

Figure 4: Partial SAS Output for Logistic Regression Model <br>
<img src="images/depressed4.jpg" alt="depressed4" style="width:75%; border:1px solid"> 

<br>

From the SAS output above, we can see that the coefficient for the Depressed item is 1.0094, indicating that the log odds of the Depressed item having a lower-numbered rating compared to the Happy item is 1.0094. Recall that a lower-numbered rating indicates that the respondent experienced the mood more frequently. Thus, respondents experienced depressive moods more often than happy moods.

Note that the SAS output also gives the odds of a respondent picking a lower-numbered rating for each mood item compared to every other mood item (not shown here).

The relative magnitude of the slopes in the output above imply the ordering of their frequency. Thus, the order of most frequently experienced mood to least frequently experienced mood among these 90 respondents is depressed, hopeless, anxious, satistfied, and happy.


###Results - R
We run the same model in R. The R code and output for the model is provided below.
