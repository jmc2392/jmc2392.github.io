#### About Me

I am currently a second-year graduate student in the Department of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University pursuing an Applied Biostatistics certificate. My academic coursework has been geared heavily toward foundational biostatistical skills using various statistical programs and languages, while my experience has involved working with various aspects of data (including data acquisition, cleaning, management, analysis, and reporting) in relation to health research. Taken together, I believe I am a formidable candidate for data scientist, analyst, programmer, and biostatistician positions. I am currently seeking these positions, or any that sufficiently develops my analytic mindset, programming/coding capability, biostatistical skills, and/or knowledge of research methods.

#### Website

**I built this website using R and GitHub (with a bit of CSS and HTML) to showcase some of the projects that I have worked on over the past couple of years.** I incorporated projects that highlight my various competencies, including:

* Usage of various statistical programs and/or languages (e.g., R, SAS, SQL)
* Ability to write scientific or research papers
* Understanding of how to clean, manipulate, and analyze data
* Knowledge of how to apply various regression techniques and interpret models (e.g., linear, logistic)

Note that all projects use hypothetical data, with the exception of the NHANES projects.
